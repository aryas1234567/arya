<h3>Week 1:</h3>
I focused on workiking on the setup and creating my website. I worked with some CSA students and setup by "arya" repository. I then began to work on basic HTML and work on the frameworks of my website. I added a theme, and I created by aboutme subpage.

<h3>Week 2:</h3>
I started to implement javascript and other features onto my website. I added img tags and finished my about me page. I also added a subpage onto my homepage that takes you to the valorant blog that I created with my partner. I also implemented more than one theme to make my website look better.

<h3>Week 3:</h3>
I began to run into a problem with my commit. My commits kept failing. I looked at the error logs on the server and noticed the version numbers for some libraries. I had incompatible versions of libraries, so I went back to an older version of the bin folder which restored the correct libraries, and my commit started working.

<h3>Week 4:</h3>
I began to create more subpages to complete the hacks. The first thing I added was a cookie clicker game. I used javascript and many buttons to complete this. I also added a sound effect on click of the cookie. The next thing I added was a snake game using javascript. I experimented with chatGPT and asked it to write me acode for snake, and it worked well. 

<h3>Week 5:</h3>
I started to add different elements to my games. I added a random chance to get a golden apple in my snake game, which adds an extra life to your snake, as well as a live counter for the game. I also added a calculator similar to the google calaculator, which has a history as well.
