<h3>Week 1:</h3>
I focused on workiking on the setup and creating my website. I worked with some CSA students and setup by "arya" repository. I then began to work on basic HTML and work on the frameworks of my website. I added a theme, and I created by aboutme subpage.

<h3>Week 2</h3>
I started to implement javascript and other features onto my website. I added img tags and finished my about me page. I also added a subpage onto my homepage that takes you to the valorant blog that I created with my partner. I also implemented more than one theme to make my website look better.
