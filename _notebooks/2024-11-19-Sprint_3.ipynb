    "For Sprint 3, our task was to plan, design, code, and develop a fully interactive social media platform where users could chat and engage with each other. For Mr. Brown’s Period 1 class, our theme was “Shared Interests,” and we chose the subtheme of school subjects. The project required both front-end development, focusing on the visual design and overall aesthetics of the site, and back-end development, which involved managing the data and content stored within the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a website where users can discuss various school subjects and topics with others. Additional features included a fully functional school timer and a resources tab. One of our main challenges was seamlessly integrating the back-end with the front-end while ensuring the website remained fully functional, especially as multiple team members worked on it simultaneously."

Overall this exeperience helped me learn how to use fetch, Postman and authenticate a working backend.
