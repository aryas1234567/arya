I chose option B, (NOT P) and Q, and the answer was NOT ( P and Q), This is right because the P and Q values are evaluted to false when both P and Q are true, and are true otherwise. I got this wrong because I have not learned about the NOT and AND logic operators."

If the if condition is not met, then it moves forwad, allowing for the program to function. I chose the option C, which checks if the robot can move forward, and if it can then to move forward then rotate right. This program will make the robot move up and down from its original position and the square above it."

    "This program has 2 input machines, both trying to display the average of the numbers. I put the answer that code segment 2 displays the correct average, but code segment 1 does not. THe right answer was that both of them display the correct average, but code segment 1 requires more arithmetic operators than code segment 2. The reason why this is true is because program 1 takes the average inside of the loop for each number, which will calculate the correct average, but do it multiple times. Program 2 takes the average after the sum if calculated for each number in the loop, which also displays the correct avergage."
